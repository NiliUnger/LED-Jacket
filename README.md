# LED-Jacket
nili's first highway project

basic BOM (needs updating with shipping)
idk if this hardware enough pitch but
LED-infused varsity jacket (it is my literal dream to own one):
roughish (very) BOM
jacket - $35
neopixel flora leds, 3 packs of 20 -  $75 total
flora adapter - $2
flora platform - $15
AA battery holder - $3
silicon cover wire (x2) - $10
most of this stuff is from adafruit
i think that's what i need
challenges:
i have literally never done any hardware projects but better late than never, im excited
i guess that's a challenge itself
also balancing how cool and patternlike i want the thing to look but also price and... safety
also where to put the battery pack is gonna be annoying since i dont want to light myself on fire
process -
get jacket, mark places where i want to install pixels
add flaps of fabric (that i add on my own) to cushion the FLORA platform
start sewing and figuring things out
program LEDs to do cool things
look awesome (:
